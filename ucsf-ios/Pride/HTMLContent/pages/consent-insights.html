		<p>The community discussion forum is where you can propose research questions or health topics that are important to you. You can also comment on topics proposed by others and indicate how important they are to you by voting a topic “up” or “down.” </p>

		<p>When you participate in the community discussion forum, identifiable information about you will not be shared. Instead, you will be represented only by the screen name you selected during enrollment. No one will be able to tell if you voted on a particular topic.
