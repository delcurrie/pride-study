		<p>You can decide to withdraw your participation in the study at any time. You can withdraw from the study directly in the app (under “Profile”) or you can contact a study researcher or staff person right away at pridestudy@ucsf.edu or <a href="telprompt://8554219991">855-421-9991</a> (toll-free) if you wish to stop being in the study.</p>

		<p>The study researchers may stop you from taking part in this study at any time if they believe that is in your best interest, if you do not follow the study rules, or if the study is stopped.</p>

		<p>Your data collected prior to withdrawing will still be used in the study. By choosing to withdraw, no data will be transmitted to the databases, and all notifications will stop. Data will remain stored within the app on your iPhone. In order to delete these data, you will need to delete the app from your iPhone.</p>
