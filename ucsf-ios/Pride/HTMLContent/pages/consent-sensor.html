		<p>You have the option to contribute data about your physical activity through built-in sensors on your iPhone or wearable activity trackers that you have linked to your iPhoneâ€™s Health app. You also have the option to share your physical location using the GPS system in your iPhone. Data about your physical activity and location will be used to test if collecting these data will be useful for research purposes in the long-term health study of LGBTQ and other sexual and gender minority people being planned.</p>

		<p>You can choose not to provide these data and still participate in this study at any time. We will not access your personal contacts, photos, text messages, emails, or other applications.</p>
