		<p>There are two options you may choose from for how The PRIDE Study handles your data:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Share with The PRIDE Study only: If you select this option, we will not share your study data with anyone. We will only use it for our research in designing a LGBTQ health study.</li>
			<li>Share with The PRIDE Study and other researchers: If you select this option, we may share your study data with other researchers. We would share data without any information that identifies you (i.e., it would be deidentified), so that you could not be identified by the data. Selecting this option permits us to share your deidentified study data with other researchers in the future.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>You can always change your preference about data sharing within the app.</p>
